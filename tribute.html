        Jack Roosevelt Robinson (January 31, 1919 â€“ October 24, 1972) was an American professional baseball player. 
        He became the first African American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era. 
        Robinson broke the baseball color line when he made his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947.
